# _αἰνίσσομαι_ - *to speak in riddles*

The purpose of this software is to effortlessly turn your cybersecurity assignment dreams into reality—complete with automatic grading.
Think of it as a CTF challenge generator, but with a twist: every participant gets their own special flag to hunt down. No copy-pasting answers here!

It may or may not be completed. Heavily work-in-progress.
